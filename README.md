# Jack-s-or-Better
Simulating the jack's or better video poker game!

This program is simulating one of the classic video poker games, the Jack's or Better video poker game.

This video poker game mimics the game of Five Card Draw.
In Five Card Draw, the player is dealt five cards out of deck.
Then the player gets to keep these cards or discard them.
The player can keep any number of cards and replace the ones they don't like.
The player gets to replace their cards only one time.
Unlike the actual Five Card Draw game, there is no betting or bluffing involved in video poker.
After the draw, payouts are made based on premade video poker pay tables.
